# WebUntis

small script to scrap the school diary entries from [WebUntis](https://mese.webuntis.com/WebUntis)


### Installing
This script runs with [Python 3](https://www.python.org).
There is a currently working [Python 2 branch](https://github.com/DaRealFreak/WebUntis/tree/Python-2.7), but I'm not going to update it anymore.

### Dependencies
 - none

### Usage
It is recommended to run WebUntis only from the command line
```
python usage.py --username "your_username" --password "your_password" [--startdate "01-01-2018"] [--enddate "15-01-2018"]
```
if no start date or end date is passed to the script it'll use the current week by default

## Development
Want to contribute? Great!

I'm always glad hearing about bugs or pull requests.
